# Journalism
**What does it mean to be a journalist?** As a journalist, you are a storyteller. As a data journalist, you tell stories thorugh data using interactive or static visualizations.

*Were it left to me to decide whether we should have agovernment without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.* — Thomas Jefferson

What's the purpose of journalism?

* To give a voice to the voiceless
* To keep people/groups accountable
* To keep readers informed about the larger world — it's empowering and fun!
* To educate readers

To be a good journalist, follow the [SPJ Code of Ethics](http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp). The major sections are:

* Seek truth and report it
* Minimize harm
* Act independently
* Be accountable and transparent

## Your role as a data journalist

Types of data journalism that you might be doing:

* Standalone stories (a project that mostly formats and supports the text)
* Standalone graphics/interactives (that tell a story by themselves)
* Supporting graphics/interactives for a story
* Live coverage
