# Resume/Hiring Tips

Here's a laundry list of tips when you're looking for tech jobs/internships.

## Resumes

* **Keep it to one page.** If *absolutely* necessary, print double-sided. Multi-page resumes (especially if they aren't stapled) are annoying to handle.
* **Tell a clear story.** A quick glance at your resume should show what you've done and what you're interested in. Use simple language, but don't shy away from industry-specific jargon.
* **Include personal projects.** If you have any personal projects you're proud of, include them on your resume. Don't include projects that you haven't started or aren't anywhere near complete.
* **No need for gimicks.** A well-organized resume printed on normal paper in black and white is fine. Concentrate on the content of your resume, not gimicks.
* **Don't say you're an expert.** Unless you're actually an expert, don't list it on your resume. Becoming an expert can take years of practice — very few people in college are actually experts.
* **DON'T LIE.** This is a *huge* red flag. Though it may help you get an initial interview, it's really easy to spot lies and exaggerations in an interview. Besides being unethical, it can easily be a reason for a company not to give you a job offer.

## Interviews

* **Remember, this is a two-way process.** Research the company and ask a lot of questions. This is *not* to impress them, but rather to utilize your interview as your chance to determine if you want to work for them.
* **Be self-aware.** Know your strengths, weaknesses, and values. (And in the case of weaknesses, know how you are/aren't trying to improve.) For every skill listed on your resume, know your level of proficiency. Be honest with yourself.
* **Know about protected classes.** Interviewers will most likely not ask any questions that involve [characteristics that are legally protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class). If an interviewer focuses on one of those too much, it might be a red flag. You can bring up your own protected characteristics, but it's often better to just focus on things directly relevant to the job.

## Etc.

* **Know what you're looking for.** It's important for the company to know if you want an internship or full-time job, what your skill levels are, and (generally) what you have experience with and want to work on.
* **Have a one-liner when introducing yourself at career fairs.** Introduce yourself and what you're looking for quickly so you can keep the conversation moving productively.
* **Have empathy.** Try to look at everything from the other point of view (e.g. by reading articles online about the other point of view). From a company's perspective, it's difficult to hire the right people with the right skills at the right time. Nobody is out to get you — companies are *trying* to hire you and often pay a lot of money to be at career fairs. (If you have a legitimate reason to believe someone is out to get you, you probably don't want to work at that company. Additinoally, if that reason involves a [protected class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class), you may have a valid legal dispute.)
* **Be yourself!** Don't be afraid to have a sense of humor or show your personality. Don't be offensive or intentionally divisive (i.e. it's probably best to steer clear of politics), but don't think that you have to hide your personality. Recruiters/interviewers will appreciate it and, if for some reason that causes you to not get the job, it's probably for the best — you probably don't want a job where you can't be yourself.
