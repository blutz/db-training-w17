# Second project: Live Earthquake Data

**Task:** Build an interactive web page that displays live earthquake data from USGS.

[Download a sample skeleton to get started &rarr;](project2-template.zip)

**Requirements:**
* Use the [USGS Earthquake GeoJSON API](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) (choose any of the live feeds)
* Display the earthquake data on your page (optionally using Handlebars)
* Style the page with a CSS file
* Add some other interactive feature of your choosing. *E.g. a live refresh function, a map, etc.*
* Track your code in Git

**Challenges:**
* Use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) instead of the USGS feed to make an interactive display of any user's repositories.
* Use one of the [Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis) to build something cool.

**Due Saturday, February 4, 2017 @ 5:00pm**
* Post your code on GitHub (preferably using gh-pages) with all requirements
* Write a short (individual) status report with (a) challenges you faced and mistakes you made and (b) something else you want to learn to do to your page
* **[Submit your project here](https://airtable.com/shrrWZezmb8NLlsGg)**
